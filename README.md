**ProceduralMotionTrack** is a custom Unity Timeline track that controls an
objectâ€™s transform using simple procedural motions.

Currently, it supports five types of motion:

- **Constant Motion**: Fixes an object at a specified position.
- **Cyclic Motion**: Moves an object using sine wave functions.
- **Brownian Motion**: Moves an object with fractal Brownian motion.
- **Follower Motion**: Makes an object follow another target.
- **Jitter Motion**: Moves an object with random values.

These motions can be blended by overlapping clips.

ProceduralMotionTrack also supports extrapolation, which is useful for creating
continuous motion throughout the entire timeline.
